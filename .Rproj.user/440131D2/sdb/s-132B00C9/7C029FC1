The expert\n    provides a small number of probability judgements, corresponding\n    to points on his or her cumulative distribution function. A range of parametric\n    distributions can then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the\n    form of fitted probabilities and percentiles. A graphical interface for the roulette elicitation\n    method is also provided. For multiple experts, a weighted linear pool can be\n    calculated. Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs about population distributions.\nLicense: GPL-2 | GPL-3\nDepends: R (>= 3.3.1)\nRoxygenNote: 5.0.1\nSuggests: testthat,\n    knitr,\n    rmarkdown,\n    GGally\nImports: ggplot2,\n    grid,\n    shiny,\n    stats,\n    graphics,\n    tidyr,\n    MASS,\n    ggExtra\nURL: https://github.com/OakleyJ/SHELF\nBugReports: https://github.com/OakleyJ/SHELF/issues\nVignetteBuilder: knitr\n",
