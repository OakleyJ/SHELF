Description: Implements various methods for eliciting a probability
    distribution for a single parameter from an expert or a group of
    experts. The expert provides a small number of probability judgements,
    corresponding to points on his or her cumulative distribution
    function. A range of parametric distributions can then be fitted and
    displayed, with feedback provided in the form of fitted probabilities
    and percentiles. For multiple experts, a weighted linear pool can be
    calculated. Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs about
    population distributions; eliciting multivariate distributions using a
    Gaussian copula; eliciting a Dirichlet distribution; eliciting
    distributions for variance parameters in a random effects
    meta-analysis model; survival extrapolation. R Shiny apps for most of the methods are
    included.
