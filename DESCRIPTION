Description: Implements various methods for eliciting a probability distribution
    for a single parameter from an expert or a group of experts. The expert
    provides a small number of probability judgements, corresponding
    to points on his or her cumulative distribution function. A range of parametric
    distributions can then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the
    form of fitted probabilities and percentiles. For multiple experts, a weighted
    linear pool can be calculated. Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs
    about population distributions, eliciting multivariate distributions using a
    Gaussian copula, eliciting a Dirichlet distribution, and eliciting distributions 
    for variance parameters in a random effects meta-analysis model. R Shiny apps  
    for most of the methods are included.
