Version: 1.1.0.9001

Description: Implements various methods for eliciting a probability distribution
    for a single parameter from an expert or a group of experts. The expert
    provides a small number of probability or quantile judgements, corresponding
    to points on his or her cumulative distribution function. A range of parametric
    distributions can then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the
    form of additional quantiles. A graphical interface for the roulette elicitation
    method is also provided. For multiple experts, a weighted linear pool can be
    calculated. Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs about population distributions.
